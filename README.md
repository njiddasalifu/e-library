## Getting Started

<!-- Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code. -->
 This is project is setup on vscode, please do well to configure it work your IDE of choice.


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies


# Database 
The Database used is found in the db file which can just be imported and pasted to create the databases and various tables needed.

#Database part
In the Database files directory,
we have the db script which can be exported into mysql server or mariaDB server to create the databases and tables used. Its a simple app though

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
